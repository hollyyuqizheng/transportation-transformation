    Overview: <br>
    Our data is divided based on which city we are examining. <br>
    This tech report will introduce our datasets on New York City and Chicago separately. <br>
    For each city, we have data on 3 categories: subway transportation, taxi usage, and population/demographics. <br>
    <br>

                      Source of original data:<br>
                      <a href="http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html" target="_blank">New York City MTA turnstile usage</a> <br>
                      <a href="http://web.mta.info/developers/MTA-Subway-Time-historical-data.html" target="_blank">New York City MTA station information</a> <br>
                      The source is reputable, since the data comes from the official New York public transit website.<br>
                      We managed to gather monthly cumulative data for 250 subway stations in New York City. <br>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Additional considerations while collecting data? <br>
                      The subway ridership data contains the number of entry and exit at each subway turnstile over 4-hour period on a given day. <br>
                      The dataset is publicly available from the New York MTA site. In addition, becaue the original dataset only contains the number of turnstile swipes, <br>
                      the information would not contain identifying information of those that take the New York subway.<br>
                      <br>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      How is the data distributed? <br>
                      The ridership dataset contains data for all MTA stations, and the usage at each station is measured every 4 hours, <br>
                      so the dataset should have a comprehensive coverage of all subway stations in the city. <br>
                      <br>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Are there any duplicates? Missing values? <br>
                      We assume that there are not duplicates from the original data from MTA. Each entry is marked by the id of the subway station. <br>
                      <br>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Are there any data type issues? Did you have to throw away any data? <br>
                      We had issue when matching each turnstile data entry with the location coordinate of the subway station, <br>
                      because the naming convention in the turnstile dataset is different from the convention in the station info dataset. <br>
                      For example, a station might be called "Grand Central - 42 St" in one dataset and "Grd Ctrl" in the other one. <br>

                      We managed to fix the above issue by manually editing the station names in one dataset so that the name matches its counterpart in the other dataset. <br>
                      For example, we replaced ""Times Square"" with ""Times Sq"" so that both datasets have the same naming convention for this location. <br>
                      Before this fixing, only around 60% of station names match. After the fix, we managed to match around 70% of all the turnstile stations with their coordinates. <br>
                      For the rest of the stations whose naming conventions across the two original data sources don't match, we decided to ignore those entries from the turnstile data. <br>

                <li> How did you collect your data? How is the source? <br>
                    The <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page" target="_blank">data</a> comes from a Freedom of Information Law request on the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, so it's reputable. <br>
                    <br>
                </li>

                <li>
                    Additional considerations while collecting data? <br>
                    Riders were likely not aware of the data collection, but the taxi companies would have been aware of the data collection. <br>
                    <br>

                <li>
                    How is the data distributed? <br>
                    There are 44 million rows (one for each ride) and 18 columns (different descriptors) of the ride. <br>
                    We care about the datetime and and the lat/lon information so that we can find daily ridership statistics for different areas in the city. </br>
                    <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Are there any duplicates? Missing values? <br>
                    There are 47 duplicated rows, which isn't very much compared to the 44 million total rows. <br>
                    There are missing values in the "congestion surcharge" column, which isn't relevant to our goals. <br>
                    <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Are there any data type issues? Did you have to throw away any data? <br>
                    The lat/lon data is in float format, which we can crosscheck with OpenStreetMap or other mapping APIs. <br>
                    We're throwing away data that isn't relevant to our goals, like the "tip amount" column. <br>

              <ol>
                  <li> How did you collect your data? How is the source? <br>
                      The Chicago Transit Authority has publicly available open data sets regarding ridership on its L line train stations <br>
                      and we were able to access data sets containing information on average monthly train ridership per station. <br>
                      This dataset tallies ridership information monthly from 2001 through 2019.<br>
                      The source is reputable; the information comes directly from the Chicago Transit Authority website. <br>
                      <br>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                      Additional considerations while collecting data? <br>
                      While subway riders are likely not aware of the extent to which this data is collected, it is reasonable in metropolitan cities to assume that <br>
                      ridership numbers are monitored for the purpose of improving transportation services and deciding on locations for new development. <br>
                      <br>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      How is the data distributed? <br>
                      There are 1717 entries in this dataset, with each entry representing one Chicago subway station's usage frequency for a month. <br>
                      The dataset covers 143 different subway stations. <br>
                      There is variation in ridership between train stations but overall the data seems to be generally uniform in how ridership is distributed at each station monthly based on sampling. <br>
                      <br>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Are there any duplicates? Missing values? <br>
                      There is no duplicate station information. There are no missing values. Each row in the dataset is completely filled. <br>
                      <br>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Are there any data type issues? Did you have to throw away any data? <br>
                      There do not seem to be any data type issues. All data is consistent with the data type denoted in the column. <br>
                      One entry from the original ridership dataset contains information about a station in Chicago that does not have a matching station id in the station information set. <br>
                      We decided to omit this station's entry, since this station appears to only exist in the dataset once for the year 2019.<br>

                  <li> How did you collect your data? How is the source? <br>
                      The City of Chicago's data portal has the taxi data publicly available -- we used the Sodapy API to scrape the data. <br>
                      <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Taxi-Trips/wrvz-psew/data" target="_blank"> Original source </a> <br>
                      The source is reputable. The original data comes from the City of Chicago's offical government data portal. <br>
                      <br>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Additional considerations while collecting data? <br>
                      I don't think that the taxi riders are aware that the information about their data is being collected, but the taxi companies have partnered with the City of Chicago, <br>
                      so the drivers know that the ride time/location data is being collected. <br>
                      <br>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      How is the data distributed? <br>
                      There are 2 million rows (one for each ride) and 23 columns (different descriptors of the ride). We mainly care about the datetime and the lat/lon of pick-up and dropoff locations. <br>
                      We want to find daily ridership in different parts of the city. We have more than 20k rows per day, so I think there's enough information. <br>
                      The data is not uniform since there are more taxi rides in areas we expect, such as O'Hare International Airport and the Loop (major business and tourism center). <br>
                      There is a max of 16,513 taxi pickups from the Near North Side (Magnificent Mile and Gold Coast areas), and a min of 1 taxi pickup from the Mount Greenwood neighborhood (far Southwest side). <br>
                      A CSV <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_areas_in_Chicago" target="_blank"> histogram</a> of pickups by community area is in data/chicago/pickups_histogram.csv.<br>
                      <br>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Are there any duplicates? Missing values? <br>
                      There are no completely duplicated rows. There might be partially duplicated information, but it's difficult to tell. <br>
                      Yes, there are missing values in almost every column. In particular, there are missing values in the pick-up and drop-off lat/lon columns, which is crucial for our analysis. <br>
                      <br>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Are there any data type issues? Did you have to throw away any data? <br>
                      The datetime format is in "Floating Timestamp" format, which I subscript in order to find the date (for the daily ridership data). The lat/lon data is in float format, which we can crosscheck with OpenStreetMap or other mapping APIs. <br>
                      We're throwing away data where the lat/lon pickup and drop-off information isn't available. We're going to throw away columns that aren't relevant to our goals. <br>
