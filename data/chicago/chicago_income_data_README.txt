The data presented in this file illustrates income demographics for the city of Chicago. This information was sourced from http://zipatlas.com/us/il/chicago/zip-code-comparison/median-household-income.htm which compiled regional information from the 2010 census.

The format of the income demographics in the csv file is as follows: 
Columns: 
	- Zip Code
	- Latitude and Longitude represented as lat #,long #
	- Location (listed as Chicago for all zip codes)
	- Average household income for this zip code

While this information may have significantly changed since 2010, we will use this information to normalize information about transportation density and accessibility because it is representative of income disparities and general inequality which can inform our analysis.

The chicago_income_data.csv is a tab-separated csv file which contains all of the zip codes for Chicago. After some rudimentary inspection, the distribution seems to be fairly consistent, with an expected degree of variation across zip codes.
