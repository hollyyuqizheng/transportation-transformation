### Instructions for scraping Chicago data ###
-- Chicago taxi data from City of Chicago's data portal --
Run chicago_taxi.py, which will create a CSV (you can comment this line out since I've already created the CSV) and print descriptive statistics about the data.

-- Chicago taxi data from Kaggle --
1. Run chicago_taxi_kaggle.py, which will print out the schema of the data (very similar to the CSV since they're from the same place).
  a. You might need to set your Google Authorization and ```pip install --upgrade google-cloud-bigquery```. I did this on my local machine, since I'm not too sure about setting up the Google Authorization on the department machine.
